We all know how boring it is to learn glossary. This is a lightweight, easy-to-use web app meant to make learning glossary easy and fun.

Glossary Tester consists of three parts:

* **Manage**: Start here by adding, editing, sorting or removing words in your word list.
* **Practice**: Before you know your glossary by heart, practice here. 
* **Test**: When you feel like you know all your words, test yourself here and get a grade!
